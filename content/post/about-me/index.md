I'm Matthew (Water261), an open source developer based in Brisbane, Australia. 
I mainly write my code in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) for web development.
In my free time I like to learn about lots of different programming and computer science topics, as of writing this my current topics are:

- Cyber Security
- Identity & Access Management

I also enjoy contributing to the [kanidm](https://kanidm.com) project when I have spare time.

## Current Set Up
To write and contribute, I currently use [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://opensuse.org) in WSL on my laptop. 
My laptop is an [Intel NUC M15 (EVO LAPRC710)](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/225967/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-kit-evo-laprc710.html) running Windows 11 Pro and my code editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
